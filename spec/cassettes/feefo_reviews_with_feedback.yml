Several choices to accommodate varied tastes, as well as options for my guest with food allergies.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>You must understand that it is a very large island and requires ALOT of driving time. During our 16hour day, over 10 hours is spent on some form of transportation.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>My one suggestion would be to have guides or &quot;spotters&quot; for the brief time at Hansen's Reserve. We were allowed only 30 minutes off the bus to explore and FIND koalas. Of the 4 found, they were VERY high in the trees. Time consuming and didn't allow time for really exploring this reserve and what it truly offers.&#13;<br/>&#13;<br/>All in all, I do recommend this tour, especially for this with minimal time or first time visitors to Australia.",
